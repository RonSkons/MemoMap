MemoMap is a web-based mapping application that enables the sharing of location-based information. With its simple and intuitive interface, anyone can contribute to and access the community's knowledge about the world around them.

Placing a memo takes two clicks, after which it is visible to everyone in the area.

## Features

- Easy to use interface for posting memos about locations
- Crowdsourced information for discovering hidden gems and enhancing community experience
- No login required, open to everyone
- Ideal for businesses to reach a wider audience and advertise products/services
- Built using open-source libraries and APIs ([Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), [FingerPrintJS](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)) 

## Contribute

MemoMap is an open-source project and contributions from the community are encouraged.
Pull requests in the form of graphical and/or UI improvements are especially helpful.

_NOTE: MemoMap is built on a LAMP stack and requires an appropriately-configured MySQL database to function. Documentation to come._

## Get Started

To start using MemoMap, visit ~~[memomap.me](https://memomap.me)~~ and start exploring. Join the community, post some memos, and help annotate your neighborhood/hiking trail/campus/anything else!

## Ideas for Future Improvements:

- Ditch fingerprinting for tried and tested logins to better identify users.
- Improve security! The app is currently very susceptible to spam from malicious users.
  - Implement a captcha-like system to counter bots
- Language filtering / harmful content flagging
- Rating system for memos
  - Ratio of good:bad ratings impacts odds of memo being displayed
- Cluster nearby markers in crowded areas
- Allow users to edit their memos
- Allow users to create memos that expire after some time
